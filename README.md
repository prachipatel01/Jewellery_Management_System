# Jewellery_Management_System
The project is an online application designed to ace up the purchasing process in a
Jewellery shop. It will record all the useful details and can also give information on
the sales that are done online or offline which will help the owner decide whether to
sell its products online or offline.

This project mainly aims at providing fast, accurate and reliable service to
customers. Also, it will be very beneficial to Jewellery shop owners as the manager
can store all the records of its monthly sales , yearly sales, credit details, customerâ€™s
information and hence will be able to estimate which is his best- selling product
which will ultimately help him in marketing and research purposes.
